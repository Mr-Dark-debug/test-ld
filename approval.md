# Implementation Approval Required

## Issues to Fix:

### 1. **Careers Page Error (403)**
- **Issue**: Browser extension permission error, not backend issue
- **Solution**: This is a browser extension conflict, not our code issue
- **Action**: Continue with implementation

### 2. **Admin Panel Modal Background**
- **Issue**: Popups have dark background overlay
- **Solution**: Remove `bg-black/60` and `backdrop-blur-sm` from modal overlays
- **Files to modify**: 
  - `app/cms-admin/components/AmenitySelector.tsx`
  - Any other modal components

### 3. **Real Data Integration**
- **Current**: About-us, contact-us, careers using localStorage/mock data
- **Solution**: Create real API endpoints and database models
- **Files to create**:
  - `models/AboutUs.ts`
  - `models/ContactUs.ts` 
  - `models/Career.ts`
  - `app/api/about-us/route.ts`
  - `app/api/contact-us/route.ts`
  - `app/api/careers/route.ts`

### 4. **User Management System**
- **Current**: Settings page has placeholder content
- **Solution**: Build complete user management interface
- **Files to modify**:
  - `app/cms-admin/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`

### 5. **Production Data Verification**
- **Current**: Some APIs may still use mock data
- **Solution**: Ensure all APIs use real database
- **Action**: Verify and update all API endpoints
